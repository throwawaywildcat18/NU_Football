A Statistical Analysis of Northwestern University's Football Success


In preparation for the Wildcats' debut in the BigTen Championship, I thought it would be interesting to take a step back and try to understand the team's performance this season. Some will argue that Northwestern simply had a slow start with QB Clayton Thorson sidelined for much of the summer with an ACL tear. This does not, however, explain our win against Purdue in our season opener, so I wanted to search for a less obvious, more powerful factor that could explain Northwestern's dominant wins against ranked opponents and devastating losses against schools like Akron and Duke.

As it is Thanksgiving break and I'm not interested in building a conventional CFB prediction algorithm from scratch, I will be using the over/under as documented by https://news.sportsinteraction.com/ as the baseline for comparing the power of new potential predictors
